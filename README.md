# Waave
A app that picks the waves for you.

## Description
This app helps surfers pick the best spot to surf for a given day. Instead of constantly checking and manually comparing different surf spots across different websites, this does all the aggregation. It will sort through different spots within your selected location and rank the best spots for your session based on your preferences.

It started as a MVP sprint project for Hack Reactor.
